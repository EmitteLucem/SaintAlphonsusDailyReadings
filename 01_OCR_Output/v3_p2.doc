\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid to deliver her from her miseries, she made answer : }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid " But how can you desire me to seek to descend from }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid the Cross, whilst I hold in my hands a God crucified ? }{\expnd1\expndtw7
\cgrid God forbid that I should do so ! I will suffer for Him }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid Who chose to suffer torments for me incomparably }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid greater than mine." This was, indeed, precisely what }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Jesus Christ sa
id to St. Teresa when she was labouring }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid under serious illness ; He appeared to her all covered }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid with Wounds, and then said to her : " Behold, My }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid daughter, the bitterness of My suff
erings, and consider if yours equal Mine." Hence the Saint was accustomed }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid to say in the midst of all her infirmities : " When I }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid remember in how many ways my Saviour suffered, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid tho
ugh He was innocence itself, I know not how it could }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid enter my head to complain of my sufferings." During }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid a period of thirty-eight years St. Lidwina was afflicted with numberless diseases\'97fevers, gout in
 the feet and }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid hands, and sores, all her life-time; nevertheless, from }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid never losing sight of the sufferings of Jesus Christ, she maintained an unbroken cheerfulness and joy. In like manner, St. Joseph of Le
onessa, a Capuchin, when the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid surgeon was about to amputate his arm, and his }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid brethren would have bound him to prevent his stirring from vehemence of pain, seized hold of the Crucifix and }{\expnd0

operation without a murmur. St. Jonas the Martyr, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid after passing the entire night immersed in ice water by order of the tyrant, declared next morning that he had never spent a happier night, because \'95 he had pictured to himself 
Jesus hanging on the Cross ; and thus, compared with the torments of Jesus, his own had seemed rather caresses than }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid sufferings.

\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid by means of the law, which we find to be above our }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid strength, our own inability to observe it, in order that }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid we may then obtain by prayer the divine aid to cure our }{

\expndtw15\cgrid us to be obliged to pray, in order to keep us humble, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid and to exercise our confidence; and He therefore permits us to be assaulted by enemies too mighty to be overcome }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid by our own strength,
 that by Prayer we may obtain }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid from His mercy aid to resist them ; and it is especially }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid to be remarked that no one can resist the impure temp\-}{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid tations of the flesh without recomme
nding himself to God }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid when he is tempted. This foe is so terrible that, when he fights with us, he, as it were, takes away all light; }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid he makes us forget all our meditations, all our good }{\expnd2
\expndtw13\cgrid resolutions ; he makes us also disregard the Truths of }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid Faith, and even almost lose the fear of Divine punish\-}{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid ments. For he conspires with our natural inclinations, }{\expnd2\expndtw14
\cgrid which drive us with the greatest violence to the indul\-}{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid gence of sensual pleasures. He who in such a moment }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid does not have recourse to God is lost. The only defence }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid agains
t this temptation is Prayer, as St. Gregory of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Nyssa says : " Prayer is the bulwark of chastity" ; and before him Solomon : \'95}{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid And as I knew that I could not }{\expnd3\expndtw15\i\cgrid otherwise be c
ontinent except God gave it, I went to }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i\cgrid the Lord and besought }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid him\'97(Wis. viii. 21). Chastity }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid is a virtue which we have not strength to practise, unless }{\expnd2\expndtw10
\cgrid God gives it to us ; and God does not give this strength }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid except to him who asks for it. But whoever prays for }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid it will certainly obtain it,

impossible to us ; for though }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid we }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid cannot observe it of our own strength, }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid we can by }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid God's assistance. " }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid It must be said t

\expndtw12\cgrid a cripple to walk straight. No, says St. Augustine, it is }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid not an injustice, provided always the means are given }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid him to find the remedy for his lameness ; for after this, }{\expnd3
\expndtw18\cgrid if he still go lame, the fault is his own. " It is most }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid wisely commanded that man should walk uprightly, so }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid that when he sees that he cannot do so of himself, he }{\expnd0\expndtw0

who knows how }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid to pray aright"; and, on the other hand, St. Francis of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Assisi says that without Prayer you can never hope to find good fruit in a soul. Wrongly, therefore, do these }{\expnd3\expndtw15
\cgrid sinners excuse themselves who say that they have no }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid strength to resist temptation. But if you have not this }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid strength, why do you not ask for it ? is the reproof which }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid St. 
James gives them : }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid You have not, because you ask }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid not\'97(James iv. 2). There is no doubt that we are too }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid weak to resist the attacks of our enemies. But, on the }{\expnd3
\expndtw19\cgrid other hand, it is certain that God is faithful, as the }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid Apostle says, and will not permit us to be tempted }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid beyond our strength : }{\expnd3\expndtw19\i\cgrid God is faithful, who will not

\cgrid also the supernatural love of God, wherewith they burn, }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid draws them with such violence to be united with their }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Sovereign Good, that when they see the barrier which }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid their s

on of God tortures them incomparably }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid more than the pain of sense : " The flames of a thousand hells together could not inflict such torments as the pain }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid of loss by itself." So that those Holy Souls would
 }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid rather suffer every other possible torture than be }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid deprived for a single instant of the union with God for }{which they long. So St. Thomas says that the pain of }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Purgatory exce
eds anything that can be endured in this }{life : " The pain of Purgatory must exceed all pain of }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid this life." And Denis the Carthusian relates that a }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid dead person who had been raised to life by the inter

\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid tory : " If all the torments of the world were compared }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid with the least that can be had in Purgatory they would appear to be comforts." And he adds that if a man had }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid once felt thes
e torments, he would rather suffer all earthly sorrows that man can endure till the Day of }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid Judgment than suffer for one day the least pain of }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid Purgatory. Hence St. Cyril wrote to St. Augustine : }{\expnd2
\expndtw10\cgrid " That as far as regards the infliction of suffering, these }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid pains are the same as those of hell\'97their }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i\cgrid only difference }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid being that }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid

in this life have succoured those Holy Souls, when they come to Purga\-tory themselves, to be most succoured by others. I may }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid here observe that, in practice, one of the best suffrages is to hear Mass far them, and during the Holy

I have no wish to undertake to decide this }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid question ; but I cannot omit the exposition of the teach\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid ing of St. Thomas. In several places above quoted, and especially in his }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i
\cgrid Book of Sentences, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid he expressly lays it }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid down as certain that every one is bound to pray ; because }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid (as he asserts) in no other way can the graces necessary }{\expnd0
\expndtw3\cgrid for salvation be obtained from God, except by Prayer : }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid " Every man is bound to pray, from the fact that he is bound to procure spiritual good for himself, which can }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid only be got from God ; s
o it can only be obtained by }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid asking it of God." Then, in another place of the same }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid Book, he proposes the exact question, " Whether we }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid are bound to pray to the Saints to intercede f
or us ?" }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid And he answers as follows\'97in order to catch his real meaning, we will quote the entire passage : " According to Dionysius, the order which God has instituted for His creatures requires that things which are remote may 
be brought to God by means of things which are nearer to }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid Him. Hence, as the Saints in Heaven are nearest of all }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid to Him, the order of His law requires that we who }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\i\cgrid remaining 
in the body are absent from the Lord, }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid should }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid be brought to Him by means of the Saints ; and this is effected by the Divine Goodness pouring forth His gifts }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid through them. And as th
e path of our return to God }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid should correspond to the path of the good things which

\expndtw0\cgrid Saints, we ought to be brought to God by the same way, so that a second time we may receive His benefits by the }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid mediation of the Saints. Hence it is that we make them }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid our intercessors with
 God, and, as it were, our mediators, }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid when we ask them to pray for us." Note well the }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid words\'97" The order of God's law requires" ; and especi\-ally note the last words\'97" As the benefits of God come }{
\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid down to us by means of the suffrages of the Saints, in the }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid same way we must be brought back to God, so that a }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid second time we may receive His benefits by the media\-}{\expnd1
\expndtw7\cgrid tion of the Saints." So that, according to St. Thomas, }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid the order of the Divine law requires that we mortals }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid should be saved by means of the Saints, in that we }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid rece
ive by their intercession the help necessary far our salvation. He then puts the objection that it appears superfluous to have recourse to the Saints, since God is }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid infinitely more merciful than they, and more ready to }{\expnd0
\expndtw0\cgrid hear us. This he answers by saying : God has so ordered }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid not on account of any want of clemency on His part, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid but to keep the right order which He has universally }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid est

 to the merits by which they have obtained grace for themselves, are }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid able also to save others; but that Jesus Christ, and so }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid also His Mother, have merited so much grace, that They }{\expnd2\expndtw13
\cgrid can save all men. " It is a great thing in any Saint }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid that he should have grace enough for the salvation of }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid many besides himself ; but if he had enough for the }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid salvation of a
ll men, this would be the greatest of all; }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid and this is the case with Christ, and with the Blessed }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid Virgin." And St. Bernard speaks thus to Mary : }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid " Through thee we have access to t
hy Son, 0 discoverer }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of grace and Mother of salvation, that through thee He }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid may receive us, Who through thee was given to us." }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid These words signify, that as we have access to the }
{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid Father only by means of the Son, Who is the }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw5\i\cgrid Mediator }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid of }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw4\i\cgrid Justice, }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid so we have access to the Son only by means }{\expnd0

\expndtw2\cgrid another place, that Mary has received a twofold fulness }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid of grace. The first was the Incarnation of the Eternal }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Word, Who was made Man in her most holy womb ; the }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid se
cond in that fulness of grace which we receive from }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid God by means of her prayers. Hence the Saint adds : }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid " God has placed the fulness of all good in Mary, that if we have any hope, any grace, any salvation,
 we may}{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid know that it overflows from her who }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw4\i\cgrid ascendeth abound\-}{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid ing with delights. }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid She is a garden of delights, whose }{\expnd0\expndtw0
\cgrid odours spread abroad and abound, that is, the gifts of }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid graces." So that whatever good we have from God, }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid we receive all by the intercession of Mary. And why so ? }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid Because, s
ays St. Bernard, it is God's will : " Such is }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid His will, Who would have us receive everything through }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid Mary." But the more precise reason is deduced from }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid the expression of St. Augus
tine, that Mary is justly }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid called our Mather because she co-operated by her }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid charity in the birth of the faithful to the life of grace, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid by which we become members of Jesus Christ, 
our }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Head : " But clearly she is the Mother of His members }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid (which we are), because she co-operated by her charity }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid in the birth of the faithful in the Church, and they are members of
 that Head." Therefore, as Mary co-operated }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid by her charity in the spiritual birth of the faithful, so }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid also God willed that she should co-operate by her inter\-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid cession to make them 
enjoy the life of grace in this }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid world, and the life of glory in the next; and therefore }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid the Church makes us salute her and give her absolutely the titles of " our }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid Life, }{
\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid our }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid Sweetness, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid and our }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid Hope."

s }{\fs20\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid that the Blessed Virgin, from the time she became }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid Mother of God, acquired a certain }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid jurisdiction }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid over all }{\fs20\cgrid the gra

conceived in her womb the Word of God, }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid she obtained a certain jurisdiction (if I may so speak) over every temporal procession of the Holy Ghost; so }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid that no creature could obtain any grace from G

\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid she wills." St. Bonaventure says the same : " Since}{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\sub\cgrid ,}{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid  the }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid whole Divine nature was in the womb of the Virgin, I do not fear to teac

 of }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid these Saints many Theologians have piously and reason\-}{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid ably defended the opinion that there is no grace given }{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid to us except by means of the intercession of Mary
 ; }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid so Mendoza, Vega, Paciucchelli, Segneri, Poire, Crasset, }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid and others, as also the learned Alexander Natalis, who

e }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i\cgrid grace }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid of Prayer is given to every\-}{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid one. It is in our power to pray whenever we will, as }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid David says of himself : }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid With me i
s prayer to the God of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid my }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid life ; I will say to God, thou art }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid my }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid support\'97(Ps. }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid xli. 9). On this point }{\fs22\expnd2
\expndtw13\cgrid I }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid shall later speak at length, and }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid I will make it quite clear that God gives to all men the }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid grace of Prayer in order that thereby they may obtain }{\expnd2
\expndtw12\cgrid every help, and even more than they need, for keeping }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid the Divine Law and for persevering till death. At }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid present I will only say that if we are not saved the whole }{\expnd2\expndtw11

\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid away sin, at the same time takes away all obstacles to }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid our obtaining the happiness of the Blessed ; hence the }{\expnd3\expndtw15\i0\cgrid greater our Charity the greater also and firmer is our }{
\expnd2\expndtw10\i0\cgrid Hope; Hope, on the other hand, can in no way interfere with the purity of love, because, according to the obser\-vation of St. Denis the Areopagite, love tends naturally }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid to union with the object belo
ved; or, as St. Augustine asserts in stronger terms, love itself is like a chain of }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid gold that links together the hearts of the lover and the }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid loved. " Love is as it were a kind of bond uniting two }
{\expnd3\expndtw15\i0\cgrid together." And as this union can never be effected at }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid a distance, the person that loves always longs for the }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid presence of the object of his love. The Sacred Spouse }{
\expnd1\expndtw9\i0\cgrid languished in the absence of her Beloved, and entreated }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid her companions to acquaint Him with her sorrow, that }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid He might come and console her with His presence : }{\expnd2

 honour and }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid exalt that infinite Goodness which it was His object in }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid creating us to manifest to the world : }{\expnd3\expndtw17\i\cgrid Let all those, }{\i\cgrid O }{my }{\i\cgrid God, }{says the Royal Pr

To these }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid people God says : You need not pray to Me, for I will }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid turn My eyes from you, and will not hear you : }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i\cgrid When }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid you stretch forth your hands, I

\cgrid Incline, 0 }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid my }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw7\i\cgrid God, thine ear and hear . . . For it is not for our justifica\-}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\i\cgrid tions do we present our prayers before }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid thy }{\fs20

St. Thomas, it is not necessary to }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid be the friends of God in order to obtain the grace we }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid ask for : " Prayer itself makes us of the family of God." }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid Moreover, St. Bernard uses a beau
tiful explanation of }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid this, saying that the Prayer of a sinner to escape from }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid sin arises from the desire to return to the grace of God. Now this desire is a gift which is certainly given by no }{\expnd2
\expndtw10\cgrid other than God Himself. " To what end, therefore," says St. Bernard, " would God give to a sinner this }{holy desire, unless He meant to hear him ?" And }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid indeed, in the Holy Scriptures themselves there are }{\fs20
\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid multi\-}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid tudes }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid of instances of sinners who have been delivered }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid from sin by Prayer. Thus was King Achab delivered; }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid thus King Manas

 those, therefore, who pray to God, are infal\-libly heard by Him, and receive grace in abundance : }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw14\i\cgrid He giveth to all abundantly. }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid But you should particu\-}{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid larly remark the w

\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid comes to ask a favour, immediately upbraid him with }{his offence. God does not do so to the man who prays, }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid even though he were the greatest sinner in the world, }{when he asks for some grace conducive to hi
s eternal }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid salvation. Then He does not upbraid him with the }{offences he has committed; but, as though he had never displeased Him, He instantly receives him, He consoles him, He hears him, and enriches him with an abundance }{
\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid of His gifts. To crown all, our Saviour, in order to }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid encourage us to pray says : }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw9\i\cgrid Amen, amen, I say to you, }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid if }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid

e, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid he says, " because pain of sense corres\-}{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid ponds to conversion to creatures ; and in Original Sin }{there is not conversion to creatures and therefore }{\fs20\i\cgrid pain }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6\i\cgrid 
of sense }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid is not due to Original Sin." Original Sin does }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid not imply an act in the infant deserving of punishment. Objectors oppose to this the teaching of St. Augustine, who in some place shows his opinion t
o be that children }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid are condemned }{\fs20\expnd4\expndtw20\i\cgrid even to the pain of sense. }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid But in }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid another place he declares that he was very uncertain }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid 
on this point. These are his words : " When I come to }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid the punishment of infants, I find myself, believe me, in }{great straits ; nor can I by any means find an answer." }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid And in another place he writes that 
it may be said that such children receive neither reward nor punishment : }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid " Nor need we fear that there cannot be a }{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid middle }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid sentence }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid betwe
en }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid reward }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid and }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid punishment; }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid since their }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid life was midway between }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid sin }{\expnd2
\expndtw11\cgrid and }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid good works." }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid This }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid was directly affirmed by St. Gregory Nazianzen : }{" Children will be sentenced by the just Judge neither. }{\expnd3\expndtw19
\cgrid to the glory of Heaven nor to punishment." St. }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Gregory of Nyssa was of the same opinion : " The pre\-mature death of children shows that they who have thus ceased to live will}{\expnd0\expndtw0\sub\cgrid .}{\expnd0\expndtw0
\cgrid  not be in pain and unhappiness."
\par }\sa72\sl189\slmult1\nowidctlpar\adjustright \expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid {And as far as relates to }{\fs20\i\cgrid the pain of loss, }{although these }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid children are excluded from glory, nevertheless St. }{Thomas, who had reflected 
most deeply on this point, teaches that no one feels pain for the want of that good which he is not capable of acquiring; so that as no man }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid grieves that he cannot fly, or no private citizen that he }{is not emperor, so these child
ren feel no pain at being }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid deprived of the glory of which they have never been }{made capable ; since they could never pretend to it by}{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid nature, or by their own merits. St. Thomas adds, in }{another place, a
 further reason which is, that the super\-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid natural knowledge of glory comes only by means of }{actual Faith, which transcends all natural knowledge ; so }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid that children can never feel pain for the privation o
f }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid that glory of which they never had a supernatural }{knowledge. He further says that such children will not }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid only not grieve for the loss of eternal happiness, but }{will, moreover, have pleasure in their
 natural gifts ; and will even in some way enjoy God, so far as is implied in }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid natural knowledge, and in natural love : " Rather will they rejoice in this, that they will participate much in }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid the Divine Good
ness, and in natural perfections." And }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid he immediately adds that although they will be separ\-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid ated from God, as regards the union of glory, never\-}{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid theless, " they will be united wit

\i0\cgrid Pet. 9). If, therefore, God wishes }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i0\cgrid that all should actually be converted, it must necessarily }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid be held that He gives to all the grace which they need for }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i0\cgrid actual c

\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid used to say that a temptation made known is half-}{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid conquered. Here it will be well to remark, what is }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid unanimously admitted by all Theologians, even of the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid r

 and are not certain whether they have given }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid consent to a grievous sin, ought to be perfectly assured }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid that they have not lost the Divine grace; for it is mor\-}{ally impossible that the will, confirmed i
n her good }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid purposes for a considerable lapse of time, should on a }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid sudden undergo such a total change as at once to con\-}{sent to a mortal sin without clearly knowing it. The }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid re

\expndtw12\cgrid of temptation, but had never spoken of them in confes\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid sion, since she was not conscious of ever having yielded}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid to them; and in this she had only followed faithfully }{\expnd4\expndtw23

 her some agitation from scruples; but in }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid spite of these she resumed her tranquillity on the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid strength of the obedience imposed by her confessor, not }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid to confess similar doubts. Wi

nless they }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid are aided by antecedent grace, as we have shown; never\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid theless, this also is imputed to them as a sin, because }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid this defect is left in them from previous sin\'97as a }
{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid drunken man is not excused from murder committed in that drunkenness which was incurred by his own fault. }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid Besides, although he who is in sin has it not in his own }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid power that he ma

 him }{as sin." From this they gather that St. Thomas intends }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid to say that sinners can indeed avoid particular sins, but }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid not all sins ; because in punishment for sins previously committed they are deprived
 of all actual grace.

id all sin, they }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid fall, and are all the same worthy of punishment ; but his }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid intention is to prove against the Pelagians that a man }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid who remains }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid without

 able to bear it\'97(1 }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Cor. x. 13). And Primasius }{explains : " God will so order the issue that we shall be }{\expnd5\expndtw29\cgrid able to endure," that is, in temptation He will }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid strengthen you with
 the help of His grace, so that you }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid may be able to bear it. St. Augustine and St. Thomas }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid go so far as to say that God would be unjust and cruel }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid if He obliged any one to a command
 which he could not }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid keep. St. Augustine says : " It is the deepest injustice }{to reckon any one guilty of sin for not doing that which }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid he could not do." And St. Thomas : " God is not more cruel than man

 imperfect obstinacy of the }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid hardened sinner which St. Thomas describes : " }{\expnd2\expndtw13\b\cgrid He is }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid hardened who cannot easily co-operate in his escape }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid from sin; and thi

and the mind is obscured, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid the will is hardened against God's inspirations, and at\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid tached to the pleasures of sense, so as to despise and feel}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid disgust for spiritual things, and the
 sensual passions and }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid appetites reign in the soul through the bad habits that }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid have been acquired. While on the other hand the illumi\-}{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid nations and the callings of God are, by its
 own fault, }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid rendered scarcely efficacious to move the soul, which has }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid so depised them, and made so bad a use of them that it }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid even feels a certain aversion towards them because it

\expndtw0\cgrid and especially by Honoratus Tourneley, who treats the }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid matter fully. All these authors prove that every man, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid by means of the ordinary sufficient grace alone, can }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid ac
tually pray without need of further aid, and by }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Prayer can obtain all the graces requisite for the per\-formance of the most difficult things.
\par }\sb0\sl184\slmult1\nowidctlpar\adjustright \expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid {It was also held by Cardinal Noris, who proves the }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid proposition that man, when the Commandment urges, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid can pray if he will ; and he p
roves it in this way : }{Assuming }{\fs20\cgrid that, in }{order to keep the Commandments and to be saved, Prayer is necessary, as we proved in the }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid beginning }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid when we }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid spoke of
 }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid the }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid Necessity of Prayer, this learned author says that every one has the proxi\-}{mate power of Prayer, in order that by Prayer he may }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid obtain the proximate power to do good; 
and therefore }{all can pray with only the ordinary grace, without other }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid assistance. Otherwise, he argues, if, in order to obtain }{the proximate power for the act of Prayer we require }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid another power, we sh
ould still want another power of grace to obtain this power, and so on }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6\i\cgrid ad infinitum, }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid and }{it would no longer be in the power of man to co-operate in his salvation.
\par }\sb72\sa72\sl187\slmult1\nowidctlpar\adjustright {The same author held it as certain that in the present state all men have the assistance }{\fs20\i\cgrid sine qua non, i.e., }{ordi\-nary grace, which, without need of further assistance, }{\expnd1
\expndtw7\cgrid produces Prayer, by which we can then obtain effica\-}{cious grace to enable us to observe the Law. And hence we can easily understand the axiom universally received }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid in the }{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid Schools :
 " }{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid Facienti quod in se est, Deus }{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid non }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw14\i\cgrid denegat gratiam." To him who does what in him lies, }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\i\cgrid God does not refuse His grace. }{
\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid That is, to }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid the man }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid who }{prays, and thus makes good use of the sufficient grace }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid which enables him to do such an }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw6\i\cgrid easy th
ing as to pray, }{God does not refuse the efficacious grace to enable him to execute }{\fs20\i\cgrid difficult things.
\par }\sa0\sl189\slmult1\nowidctlpar\adjustright {Thus also, Louis Thomassin, who says that " sufficient grace," to be really }{\fs20\i\cgrid sufficient, }{\fs20\cgrid ought }{to }{\fs20\cgrid give a man the }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid proximate and }{
\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid ready power to execute a good act. But }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid if, in order to perform such an act, another grace\'97}{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid namely, efficacious grace\'97is needed, and a man has not, }{at least, mediately, this 
efficacious grace which is neces\-sary for \'95salvation, how can it be said that the "sufficient grace" gives him this proximate and ready power ? But Saint Thomas says : " God does not neglect to do that }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid which is necessary to sa
lvation." It is true, of course, }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid that God is not bound to give us His grace, because }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid what is gratis is not of obligation; but, on the other }{hand, supposing that He gives us Commandments, He is obliged t
o give us the assistance necessary for observing }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid them. And as God does oblige us actually to observe }{every precept whenever it applies, so ought He also }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid actually to supply us (at least mediately or remot
ely) }{with the assistance necessary for the observance of the }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid precept, without the necessity of a further grace which }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid is not common to all. Hence Thomassin concludes that }{\expnd0\expndtw2\cgrid in order
 to reconcile the proposition that }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw2\i\cgrid sufficient grace }{is enough for a man's salvation with the statement that }{\fs20\i\cgrid efficacious grace }{is requisite to observe the whole Law, it is necessary to say that }{\fs20\i
\cgrid sufficient grace is enough to pray, }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid and to perform similar }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid easy acts, }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid and that by means of }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid these we then }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8
\i\cgrid obtain efficacious grace to fulfil the diffi\-}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw5\i\cgrid cult acts. }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid And this is without doubt in conformity with }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid the doctrine of }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid St. }{\expnd1
\expndtw7\cgrid Augustine, who teaches : " By the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid very fact that it is most firmly believed that the just }{and good God does not command impossibilities, we are admonished both what to do in easy things, and in diffi\-cult things
 what to ask for." On this passage Cardinal }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid Noris observes : " Therefore, we are able to do easy or }{less perfect works without asking God for further help ; }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid for which, however, we must pray in more diffi
cult }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid works." Thomassin also brings forward the authority }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid of St. Bonaventure, Scotus, and others on this subject, }{and says that all these considered sufficient graces to be }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid truly 
sufficient, whether the will consents to them or }{not. And this he demonstrates in four parts of his book,

oes not persuade it thus to consent"; }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid and for this doctrine he quotes Gamaches, Duval, Isam\-}{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid bert, Perez, Le Moyne, and others. Then he proceeds : }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid " The assistance, therefore, o
f sufficient grace disposes us for the reception of efficacious grace, and is in some }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid sort efficacious, namely, of an incomplete effect, obtained }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid first remotely, then more nearly, and at last proximately }

that this sufficient grace }{was the grace of asking or of Prayer, of which St. Augus\-}{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid tine so often speaks." So that, according to Habert, the }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid difference between efficacious and sufficient grace is that
 }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid the former produces its effect completely while the latter }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid produces it either contingently (that is, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid sometimes, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid but }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid not }{
\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid always), }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid or mediately (that is, by means of Prayer). }{Moreover, he says that sufficient grace, according to the }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid good use we make of it, prepares us to obtain efficacious }{
\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid grace ; hence he calls sufficient grace " in some sort }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid efficacious" }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid (secundum quid), }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid because of its effect com\-}{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid menced but no
t completed. Lastly, he says that suffi\-}{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid cient grace is the grace of Prayer, of which it is in our power to avail ourselves, as St. Augustine teaches. So }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid that a man has no excuse if he does not do that w
hich }{he already has sufficient grace to enable him to perform, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid seeing that without further assistance he has the suffi\-}{}{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid cient grace either to act, or at least obtain more help to }{\expnd3\expndtw18

 this sense, as we have already explained, he says the celebrated axiom of }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid the Schools is to be understood : "To those who do what }{is in their power" (by means of sufficient grace) " God }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid does not deny g

\expndtw13\i\cgrid God admon\-ishes you to do what you can, and to ask for }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid what }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid you }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid cannot do."

thou shalt glorify }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid me\'97(Ps. xlix. }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid 15). He honours the power, the mercy, and the faith- }{fulness of God; since he believes that God can and will }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid save him; and that He cannot fa

pressly declared : " All men }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i0\cgrid ought to place and repose a most firm Hope in the help }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid of God; for God, unless they fail to correspond to His grace, as He has begun the good work, will also finish }{
\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid it, working in them both to will and to perform." And }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid speaking of himself, St. Paul had already said : }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid I }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid know }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid whom I h
ave believed, and I am certain that he is able }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid to keep that which I have committed unto }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i0\cgrid him\'97(2 Tim. }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid i. }{\expnd2\expndtw13\b\i0\cgrid 12). }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid 
And herein is the difference between }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Christian }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid hope and }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid worldly }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid hope. Worldly hope need only be an }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid uncertain expecta
tion ; nor can it be otherwise; for it }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid is always doubtful whether the man who has promised }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid a favour may not hereafter change his mind, if he has }{\expnd4\expndtw21\i0\cgrid not already changed it.
 But the Christian Hope of }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid Eternal Salvation is certain on God's part ; for He can }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid and will save us, and has promised to save those who }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid obey }{\expnd1\expndtw8\b\i0
\cgrid His }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid Law, and to this end has promised us all neces\-}{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid sary graces to enable us to observe this Law, if we ask }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i0\cgrid for them. It is true that Hope is accompanied by fear, 
as }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid St. Thomas says ; but this fear does not arise from God's }{\expnd1\expndtw5\i0\cgrid side, but from our own, since \'95 we may at any time fall by }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid not corresponding as we ought and by putting an 
impedi\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid ment in the way of grace by our sins. For this reason }{\expnd1\expndtw7\i0\cgrid then, did the Council of Trent condemn those innovators, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\i0\cgrid who, because they entirely deprive man of free will
, say }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i0\cgrid that every believer must have an infallible certitude of }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid perseverance and salvation. This error was condemned }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid by the Council; because, as we have said, in order to
 }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid obtain salvation our correspondence is necessary, and }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i0\cgrid this correspondence of ours is uncertain and fallible. }{\expnd1\expndtw7\i0\cgrid Hence God wills that we should, on the one hand, always }{
\expnd1\expndtw9\i0\cgrid fear for ourselves, lest, trusting in our own strength, we }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i0\cgrid should fall into presumption, but, on the other, that we
\par }\sa0\nowidctlpar\adjustright \expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid {should be always certain of His good will, and of His }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid assistance to save us, provided always that we ask Him }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid for it, so that we may always h

power and mercy, and believing that He }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid can and will save us. " Whoever has Faith, is certain }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of God's power and mercy."

\expndtw14\cgrid follows that the motive of our Hope must also be cer\-}{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid tain; for if the foundation of our Hope were uncertain, }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid and open to a doubt, we could not with any certainty }{\expnd3\expndtw16
\cgrid hope and expect to receive salvation, and the means }{necessary for it from the hands of God. St. Paul insists }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid on our being firm and immovable in our Hope, if we }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid would be saved : }{\expnd1\expndtw8

 confirms in }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid another place where he says that our Faith ought to be }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid as immovable as an anchor securely fixed, since it is }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid grounded on the promises of God Who cannot deceive : }{
\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid And we desire }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid that }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid every one of }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid you }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid show forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end

 comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid us, which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i0\cgrid firm\'97(Heb. vi. 11-19). Hence St. Bernard says that }{\expnd4\expndtw20\i0
\cgrid our Hope cannot be uncertain, as it rests on God's }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid promises : " Nor does this expectation seem to us vain, }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i0\cgrid or this Hope doubtful, since we rely on the promises of }{\expnd3\expndtw15\i0
\cgrid the Eternal Truth." In another place St. Bernard says }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid of himself that his hope depends on three things\'97the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i0\cgrid love which induced God to adopt us as His children, the }{\expnd3\expndtw15\i0
\cgrid truth of His promises, and His power to fulfil them : }{\expnd1\expndtw7\i0\cgrid "Three things I see in which my Hope consists\'97the love }{\expnd3\expndtw19\i0\cgrid of adoption, the truth of the promise, the power to }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i0

\expndtw11\cgrid anxiety was crowned with the happiest success \'95 for of }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid the three brothers of Alphonsus, one became a lienedic- }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid tine ; another chose the sacerdotal state, and lived a most }{\expnd4
\expndtw20\cgrid holy life in his father's house ; and the third, who married, led a life worthy of a good Christian. Of }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid his sisters, two became nuns, and dedicated their virginity }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid to Christ ; the third, 
who was married, was a model of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Christian mothers. But Alphonsus himself became the pride and glory, not only of his own family but of the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid whole Church. Even in his old age he used to thank }{God for hav

\cgrid until his death. As for sin, the pleasures of the world, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid and the company of the licentious, all these he fled from }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid as from a serpent. In order to tread more securely in }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid the
 path of virtue, by the advice of his mother, he joined }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid the Congregation of Young Nobles, and so perfectly }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid observed the rules of this confraternity that, as the }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid Roman Breviary t
estifies, all the young noblemen were }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid drawn to Christian modesty by his words and example. }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid His pious manner of life obtained for him the gift of a}{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid high contemplation, even when he
 had scarcely reached }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid his twelfth year, as is proved by the following remark\-}{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid able occurrence. On a certain occasion he had been }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid taken, with some of his companions, to a country
 house }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid for recreation. The boys began to play at some game, }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid in which they wished Alphonsus to join. At first he }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid refused, but finally, yielding to their importunities, he }{
\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid took part in the game. Fortune favoured him to such an extent that one of his companions, envious of his }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid success, completely lost his temper and broke out into }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid blasphemies against
 God. As soon as the pious youth }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid heard these imprecations, indignant that God should be }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid thus outraged for such a trifle, he at once quitted the }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid company, and retired into a neigh

me the chief object of his }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid care to exhibit himself by the practice of every kind of }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid virtues ' as a minister of God' and a dispenser of His }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid mysteries.' Of chastity, which he had 
long since conse\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid crated by vow to God, he was ever the most watchhil }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid guardian, incessantly exerting all the powers of his mind, }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid and employing every movement of his body to prese
rve }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid it free from the slightest stain. To attain this object with perfect security he dedicated that virtue with filial confi\-}{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid dence to the care of the Mother of God. With so vehe\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14
\cgrid ment an impulse of love was he carried towards God. }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid that his attention was unceasingly fixed upon Him, }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid and nothing seems to have afforded him pleasure but }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid to think and sp

\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid steeped in vice and wickedness to the loving embraces }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid of God. It was his constant occupation to visit the }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid hospitals for the purpose of assisting the sick, and of}{\expnd2\expndtw14

with the greatest }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid patience, and to spend in the performance of that office not only whole days, but also a considerable part of the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid night. Hence, too, was he in the habit of addressing }{\expnd2
\expndtw11\cgrid from the pulpit his crowded audience in strains of such }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid fervid language as to conquer and break down the }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid obstinacy of the most abandoned sinners. He exhibited }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid t

 St. Francis, appeared to her, and showed her }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid a number of priests zealously engaged in instructing a }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid countless multitude of men, who were scattered through }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid villages and hamlets, d
eprived of spiritual aid. The leader }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid and director of these priests was Alphonsus. Whilst the }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid holy religious was contemplating this vision, these words }{sounded in her ear : " That is the man whom I have
 }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid chosen as My instrument in this work, which is to glorify }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid My Name." She did not think it right to conceal a fact }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid of so great importance, and spoke of it to Alphonsus, }{\expnd2
\expndtw10\cgrid who was greatly agitated on hearing a revelation which }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid coincided so perfectly with his own desires. Being in }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid doubt as to the course which he ought to take, he }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid d
etermined at once to give himself up to the most fer\-}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid vent prayer, and to redouble his austerities, in order }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid to obtain a more certain knowledge of the Divine Will. }{\expnd5\expndtw25\cgrid His hopes wer
e not deceived. In a short time he }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid clearly perceived that he wa}{\expnd3\expndtw19\super\cgrid g}{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid  called by God to this }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid great work, both by the heavenly light with which his soul
 }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid was abundantly illumined, and also by the advice which }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid he received from many men illustrious both for their learning and their sanctity. He was confirmed in this }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid conviction by th
e approbation of his director, the saintly Bishop Falcoja. From this time Alphonsus bound himself }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid by vow to depend entirely on the direction of this holy }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid prelate. Moreover, in addition to all this, the wi
ll of God was made plain by a manifest miracle. One day when the }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid nun of whom we have spoken, was eagerly maintaining in the presence of her sisters the truth of the revelation }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid made to her, one of her hea
rers exclaimed : " Well, I }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid shall believe it when Sister Mary Magdalene is cured." }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid Wonderful to relate, this Religious, who was then out of her mind, was at that very instant freed from her mental }{

 be mentioned a young man of good family whose past life had been far from edify\-}{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid ing, but who now received a vocation to join Alphonsus, }{which was evidently miraculous. This youth, who was }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid called Vitus 
Curzio, himself related what had happened. }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid " I dreamt," says he, " that I was standing at the foot }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid of a high and steep mountain which many priests were }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid trying to ascend. I wishe
d to follow them, but at each }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid attempt my foot slipped, and I fell back. Seeing that }{all my efforts to advance were useless, I began to feel }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid exceedingly disheartened and sad. At last, one of the }{
\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid priests taking compassion on me, stretched out his hand, }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid and with his help I ascended the mountain with the }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid rest." Such was the young man's dream. A few days }{\expnd3\expndtw18
\cgrid after he met Alphonsus in Naples, and, struck with }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid astonishment, he recognised in him the priest whom he }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid had seen in his dream, and who had helped him to }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid ascend the mount
ain. Moved by Divine grace he at }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid once obeyed the wonderful call he had received from Heaven, and became the first Lay-brother of the new }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Institute.

ce by placing before him the patience of the }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid stoics; but turning to the Crucifix he said : " There is }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid true patience !" He meant to say that the example of }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid a God Who once suffere
d so much for the love of us is sufficient to animate us to endure all pain for the love }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid of Him. " The ignominy of the Cross," says St. Ber\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid nard, " is agreeable to him who is not ungrateful to a }{
\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid crucified God." To him who loves his crucified Saviour }{\expnd5\expndtw28\cgrid pains and opprobrium are agreeable. When St. }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Eleazar was asked by his virgin spouse, St. Afra, how }{\expnd3\expndtw18
\cgrid he could submit to so many insults from the rabble }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid without seeking revenge, he said : " My spouse, think }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid not that I am insensible to these insults ; I feel them }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid keenly ; 
but I turn to Jesus on the Cross, and continue to look at Him until my soul becomes tranquil." Love, says St. Augustine, makes all things easy. After being }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid wounded with Divine love, St. Catherine of Genoa used }{\expnd5\expndtw27
\cgrid to say that she knew not what it was to suffer. }{Although she endured the most grievous pains, she felt }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid none of them, because she regarded them as sent by }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid Him who loved her so tenderly. Thus also
 a good }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid religious of the Society of Jesus, when God visited him }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid with any pain, sickness, or persecution, used to say }{within himself : " Tell me, 0 pain, sickness, or persecu\-}{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid

Yet there were three Mysteries of }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid this Divine life that he loved to dwell upon with a }{special affection : the Incarnation of the Divine Word ; }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid His Passion and Death; and that immense love which }{

\expndtw14\cgrid they formed the usual subjects of his sermons, and he }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid explained them with such unction that he seemed to be }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid an angel rather than a man. In order to communicate }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid

 Him with complete indifference, or with cold }{respect, he would exclaim, in bitter grief : " Poor Jesus }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid Christ ! poor Jesus Christ !" And it was this compassion }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid for his outraged Saviour that urged him t

re liberally supplied by him with }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid food, clothes, and money ... From his own revenue he }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid was accustomed to give young women the portion }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid necessary to enable them to enter the marri
age state ; }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid and he supported, at his own expense, young ecclesiastics of poor and humble parentage while pursuing their course }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid of studies." Towards the close of the year 1763 the }{\expnd2\expndtw13
\cgrid diocese of St. Agatha was visited by a severe famine, which lasted until the Spring of the following year. It was then that the holy Bishop displayed a charity that }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid was truly heroic. The distress of the people was so }{
\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid great that it was feared many would die of hunger, and}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid in order to relieve his suffering poor Alphonsus not only }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid sold all the furniture in his house, but even disposed of his pectora
l cross and his episcopal ring. And as things grew worse instead of better, he wrote to the Sovereign }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid kontiff imploring to be allowed to make use of the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid revenues of the bishopric in feeding the poor. Mea
n\-}{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid time, to avert the wrath of God, he did not cease to }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid exhort his people to do penance, whilst he himself added }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid to his usual austerities, until after the lapse of six months }{
\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid he had appeased the Divine justice by his prayers and }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid mortifications. But if we wished to relate all that }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid Alphonsus did for his diocese during the thirteen years }{\expnd2

\expndtw8\cgrid that Alphonsus might present to his children an example }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid of patience as admirable as that of holy Job. We will }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid relate in few words this painful history. The Congrega\-}{\expnd3\expndtw19
\cgrid tion of the Most Holy Redeemer had, from its very }{commencement, to sustain the most determined opposi\-}{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid tion. Its enemies were neither few in number nor }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid wanting in ability and influence, and if t
he little flock }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid was not dispersed, it was owing to the special protection }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid of Heaven. The Marquis Tannucci, Prime Minister of the King of Naples, was a bitter enemy of the Church }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid a
nd Religious Orders, but happily for the Congregation, }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid he resigned his office, and was succeeded by the Marquis }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid della Sambuca. The new Minister had a great esteem }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid for Alphonsus, 
and thus happier days seemed about to }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid dawn upon the rising Institute.

fear the suppression of his }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid houses, and that he could now establish his Institute on }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid a permanent footing. Relying on the good-will of the }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Minister, della Sambuca, he determined 
to make every }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid effort to attain this desirable end ; and having taken the }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid advice of the principal members of his Congregation, }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid he sent Father Majone to Naples to treat with the }
{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Government for the approbation of his Institute. Who }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid would ever believe that this father, after having been }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid entrusted with so sacred a duty, betrayed the confidence }{\expnd2
\expndtw14\cgrid placed in him, and acted the part of a traitor ? Yet so }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid it was. In order to obtain the royal approbation with }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid greater facility, he did not shrink from making changes }{\expnd2\expndtw12
\cgrid of the greatest importance in the rules, and this on his }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid own responsibility, and although these rules had been }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid solemnly confirmed by the Supreme Pontiff. He then }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid presente
d the rules thus altered for the approbation of }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid the King. Although Majone acted in this matter with }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid the greatest secrecy and caution, yet he could not pre\-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid vent some suspicion of
 the plot from entering the minds }{of certain of the fathers. They, in great anxiety, applied}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid to Alphonsus, begging him to be on his guard against }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid the plots of his representative. But the holy old man }{
\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid could not believe Majone would be guilty of such }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid perfidy, and he was all the more unsuspicious because he had been deceived in this matter by Father Villani, }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid who was both his conf
essor and his Vicar-General. }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid Father Majone had sent to the holy founder a copy of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid the new rule, which he had composed with the help of }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid one of the King's chaplains ; but this was
 written in }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid such small characters that Alphonsus could not read it. }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid He gave it, therefore, to Father Villani, who read it }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid through; and fearing to grieve Alphonsus if he revealed
 the treachery, unwisely concealed it, and contented him\-}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid self with saying that all was right. Thus it happened }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid that Alphonsus believed that the anxiety of the Fathers }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid was simpl
