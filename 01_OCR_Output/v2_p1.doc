 loving or more tender than in this one, in }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid which, as it were, He annihilates Himself and reduces Himself into food in order to penetrate our souls, and }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid unite Himself to the hearts of His faithful ones."
 So }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid that, says St. John Chrysostom, " to that Lord on }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid whom the Angels even dare not fix their eyes, to Him we }{unite ourselves, and with Him we are made one body, one }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid flesh." Bu

\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid to Himself. There are many mothers who give their }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid children to others to nurse ; but this He has not done, }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid but feeds us with }{\expnd3\expndtw17\b\cgrid His }{\expnd3\expndtw17
\cgrid own Blood. In short, says the Saint, because He loved us so ardently, He chose to }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid make Himself one with us by becoming our food. " He }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid mingled Himself with us, that we might be one ; this they }{do

 The }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid Superior then told him to pull up another tree of greater }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid growth : to perform this task all the strength of the young }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid monk was necessary. Lastly, the venerable Father }{
\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid commanded the disciple to tear up a tree which had taken }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid deep root. In obedience to this precept, the young }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid religious exerted all his strength ; but his efforts were }{\expnd2

 strength and vigour by evil habits. }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid This truth is confirmed by daily experience. If when }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid you receive an insult you feel a motion of resentment, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid but you at once stifle the spark

Whence the same Saint, considering }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Mary on Mount Calvary, present at the death of her Son, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid questions her in these words : " 0 Lady, tell me, where }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid didst thou stand ? Was it only

 of this }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid love consists in being prepared to lose all things rather }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid than forfeit the grace of God. Does the Lord demand }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid too much of us when He requires that we prefer Him to }{
\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid everything in this world ? And what are creatures com\-}{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid pared with God ? The Emperor Domitian tempted }{St. Clement to worship idols by presenting to him as the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid reward of his impiet
y, gold, silver, and precious stones. The Saint heaved .a deep sigh, and began to weep when }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid he saw his God compared with earthly goods. We }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid should be ashamed to say to God : Lord, I love Thee above all th
ings. For to speak in this manner to God }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid would be the same as if we said to a king : My sovereign, }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid I esteem you more than chaff and mire ! But our God }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid is content with being loved
 above all creatures, which, }{compared with His sovereign Majesty, are infinitely less }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid than chaff or mire is in comparison with the first monarch }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid of the universe. Father Vincent Carafa, of the Society of
 Jesus, used to say that were the whole world in his }{possession he would surrender it in an instant at the bare }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid Name of God. It is necessary, then, to live always in }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid such a disposition of mind that we 
be always ready to }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid forfeit property, character, life, and all things sooner than }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid lose God. We must say with St. Paul : }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid Nor height, nor }{\expnd1\expndtw5\i\cgrid depth, nor }{
\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid any }{\expnd1\expndtw5\i\cgrid other creature, shall be able to separate us }{\expnd5\expndtw27\i\cgrid from the love of God.\'97(Rom. }{\expnd5\expndtw27\cgrid viii. 39). He that }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid feels he cannot live witho

\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid by a deliberate venial sin, but should also prefer the }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid pleasure of God before all self indulgence, and should be }{prepared to suffer every pain in order to please his Lord. Jesus Christ has preferred your 
salvation before His own }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid life ; in you, then, it is not much, nay, it is nothing, to }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid prefer His pleasure to every personal good.

 Jesus Christ}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid showed His love for us. He that desires to suffer for }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid Jesus, desires, or at least embraces in peace, the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid occasions of suffering. For loving souls tribulations are, a
s it were, the way to union with God ; for in sufferings }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid they unite themselves with Him by stronger love. }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Father Balthasar Alvarez used to say, " that he who in }{afflictions peacefully resigns himself t
