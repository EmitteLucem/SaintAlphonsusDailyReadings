\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid and directions to those who labour for the salvation of }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid souls."

ay }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid to solid virtue, and smoothes for them the way to the }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid highest Christian perfection. His Holiness adds that the }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid Saint's one great ambition in all his writings was to make }{

\expndtw19\cgrid consented to mortal sin, may remain certain of not }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid having lost the grace of God; because it is morally }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid impossible that a person well confirmed in good pur\-}{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid pose

a certain }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid sin, or circumstance of sin, he is not bound to confess }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid it; because he can prudently judge that it has been }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid already sufficiently confessed. }{\expnd1\expndtw8\sub

re should be no consent. St. Philip }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid Neri used to say that a temptation disclosed is half-}{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid conquered. I have said that it is very profitable to }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid some : }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid 
for with regard to others of tried virtue, who are }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid too timid on this point and are always afraid of having }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid consented to sin, it is sometimes useful to forbid them to confess such temptations, unless they
 are certain of }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid having yielded to them. For by the very examination that such persons make in order to ascertain whether }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid they have consented or not, and thinking of the manner }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid i
