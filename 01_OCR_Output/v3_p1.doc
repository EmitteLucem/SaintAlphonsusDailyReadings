\expndtw10\cgrid of ambition, of liking to be seen, of heaping up money, }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid of resentment against a neighbour, or of inordinate affec\-}{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid tion for a person of a different sex. In such cases there }{

{Communion, so much recommended by the Council of Trent, which exhorts all the faithful to practise it. The }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Spiritual Communion, as St. Thomas says, consists it }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid an ardent desire to receive Jesus Christ i
n the Holy }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Sacrament ; and therefore the Saints were careful to make}{it several times in the day. The method of making it is }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid this : " My Jesus, I believe that Thou art really present }{\expnd2\expndtw14
\cgrid in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love Thee and I desire }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid Thee ; come into my soul. I embrace Thee ; and I }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid beseech Thee never to allow me to be separated from }{Thee again." Or more briefly, thus : " M
y Jesus, come }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid to me ; I desire Thee ; I embrace Thee ; let us remain }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid ever united together." This Spiritual Communion may }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid be practised several times a day : when we make our }{
\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid prayer, when we make our Visit to the Blessed Sacra\-}{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid ment, and especially when we assist at Mass at the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid moment of the priest's Communion. The Dominican }{Sister, Blessed Angela of

 : " Prayer, though it is only one, can effect all things," as Theodoret says ; whoever prays obtains from }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid God whatever he chooses. The words of David are }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid beautiful : }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid Ble

holy will. St. Teresa }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid says : " The Lord never sends a trial without remunerat\-}{\fs20\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid ing it with some favour as often as we accept it with }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid resignation."

\cgrid an obedience, although the thing enjoined suits their }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid inclination, yet, from the very fact of its being com\-}{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid manded, they lose all fancy for it, all wish to discharge }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid it ; f

 }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid grant them such a permission ; for they had never spent }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid such a wearisome day as that on which they had been }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid set free from obedience.

e Sales says : " To desert }{an occupation given by obedience in order to unite our\-}{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid selves with God by prayer, by reading, or by recollection, }{would be to withdraw from God to unite ourselves with }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid our
 own self-love." St. Teresa adds, moreover, that }{whoever performs any work; even though it be spiritual, yet against obedience, assuredly works by the instigation of the devil, and not by Divine inspiration, as he perhaps }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid flatt
ers himself ; " because," says the Saint, " the }{inspirations of God always come in company with }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid obedience." To the same effect she says elsewhere : }{" God requires nothing more of a soul that is determined to love Him than obed
ience." " A work done out of obedience," rays Father Rodriguez, " outweighs every
\par }{\fs16\column}\pard \s22\qj\ri144\sb72\sl184\slmult1\nowidctlpar\adjustright {other that we can imagine." To gather a straw off the ground from obedience is of greater merit than a pro\-tracted prayer, or a discipline to blood, done out of our }{
\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid own head. This caused St. Mary Magdalen de Pazzi to }{say that she would rather be engaged in some exercise from obedience than in prayer ; " because in obedience I am certain of the will of God, whereas I am by no means }{\expnd1
\expndtw9\cgrid so certain of it in any other exercise." According to }{all spiritual masters, it is better to leave off any devout exercise through obedience than to continue it without }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid obedience. The Most Blessed Virgin Mary re
vealed once }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid to St. Bridget that he who relinquishes some mortifica\-}{tion through obedience reaps a twofold profit ; since he }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid has already obtained the merit of the mortification by }{the good-will to do i
t, and he also gains the merit of obedience by foregoing it. One day the famous Father Francis Arias went to see the Blessed John of Avila, his intimate friend, and he found him pensive and sad ; he }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid asked him the reason of it, and
 received this answer : }{" Oh, happy you who live under obedience, and are sure }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid of doing the will of God. As for me, who shall warrant }{me whether I do a thing more pleasing to God in going from village to village, catechising t
he poor peasants, or in remaining stationary in the confessional to hear every }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid one that presents himself ? Whereas he that is living under obedience is always sure that whatever he per\-}{forms by obedience is according to the wil
l of God, or }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid rather that it is what is most acceptable to God." Let }{this serve as a consolation for all those who live under obedience.
