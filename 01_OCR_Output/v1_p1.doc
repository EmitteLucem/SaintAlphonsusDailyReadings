\cgrid {As for }{\i\cgrid Dryness of Spirit, }{the greatest pain of souls }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid in Meditation is to find themselves sometimes without a }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid feeling of devotion, weary of Prayer, and without any }{\expnd0\expndtw4
\cgrid sensible desire of loving God. And with this is often joined }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid the fear of being in the wrath of God through their sins, on account of which the Lord has abandoned them ; and }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid being in this gloomy dar
kness they know not any way }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid of escaping from it, for it seems to them that every way }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid is closed against them. Let the devout soul, then, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid continue steadfast in Meditation, and not 
leave off as }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid the devil will suggest. At such a time let it unite its }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid desolation to that which Jesus Christ suffered on the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid Cross. Let it repeat : My }{\expnd3\expndtw17\i\cgrid 
Jesus, mercy ! Lord, have }{\expnd5\expndtw26\i\cgrid mercy on me ! Have pity on me ! Leave me not, }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid 0 Jesus! }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid Pray, and doubt not that God will hear you }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid and grant your petitions.

\expndtw15\cgrid devil, we should follow it as a good counsel, though }{\expnd4\expndtw24\cgrid coming from an enemy. St. John Chrysostom, as }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid quoted by the same St. Thomas, says that God, when He }{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid gives suc
h Vocations, wills that we should not delay, even }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid for a moment, to follow them. Christ requires from }{\expnd4\expndtw21\cgrid us such an obedience that we should not delay an }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid instant. And why this ? Bec
ause, as God is much }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid pleased to see a soul prompt in obeying Him, He opens }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid His hand and fills that soul with His blessings. On the }{contrary, He is displeased with tardiness in obeying }{\expnd3
\expndtw18\cgrid Him ; He shuts His hand and withdraws His lights. }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid Hence, the soul will follow its Vocation with difficulty, }{\expnd5\expndtw27\cgrid and will easily abandon it. Therefore, St. John }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Chrys
ostom says that when the devil cannot bring one }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid to give up his resolution of consecrating himself to God, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid he at least seeks to make him defer the execution of it, }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid and esteems it a
 great gain if he can, obtain the delay of }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid one day, or even of an hour. And why ? Because a day later, or even an hour later, other occasions presenting }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid themselves, it will be less difficult for him to ob
tain still }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid greater delay, until he who has been called, finding }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid himself more feeble and less assisted by grace, gives way }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid altogether and loses his Vocation. Therefore, St. }{
\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Jerome gives to those who are called to quit the world }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid this advice : " Make haste, I beseech you, and }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i\cgrid cut }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid rather }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid than }{\expnd2
\expndtw10\i\cgrid untie }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid the cable by which your barque is bound fast }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid to the land." The Saint wished to say that as a man }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid who should find himself in a boat on the point of sinkin
g }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid would seek to cut the rope rather than to untie it, so he }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid who finds himself in the midst of the world ought to seek }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid to get out of it as quickly as possible, in order to free }{

\'97because }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid God has already given him light by calling him to His }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid holy House, and if he only asks for this grace, the devil, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid who can easily change himself into an angel of light,

d with golden chains in His hands wherewith they should be bound as prisoners one with the other }{\expnd5\expndtw26\i0\cgrid and never to be separated. Francis, emboldened }{\expnd6\expndtw31\i0\cgrid at this, fastened the chains to the foot of the }{

that St. Bernard says }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid it is through her intercession that we have access to Jesus }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid Christ our Mediator and Saviour. " Through thee we }{\expnd0\expndtw-1\cgrid have access to the Son, 0 thou giver of grace

\expndtw6\cgrid necessary to bring us to salvation. And will God give }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid them ? Most assuredly He will give them, and in still }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid greater abundance than we ask them. Let us observe also the words : }{\fs20
\expnd1\expndtw8\i\cgrid Upbraideth not. }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid If the sinner repents }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of his sins, and asks salvation from God, God does not that which men do, that is, reproach the ungrateful with their ingratitude, and deny th
em what they ask ; but He }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid gives to them willingly, and even more than they beg }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid for. If, then, we would be saved, }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid we }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid must have our lips ever open in 
prayer, and say : }{\fs20\expnd0\expndtw0\i\cgrid My God, help me ! My God }{\fs20\expnd2\expndtw11\i\cgrid have mercy ! Mary, have mercy ! }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid If we cease to pray, }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid we are lost. Let us pray for ourselves : le
