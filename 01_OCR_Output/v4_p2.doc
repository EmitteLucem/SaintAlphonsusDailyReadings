\cgrid such miracles, while his life was not more exemplary }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid than that of others. In reply, he said that it was a }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid matter of astonishment to himself also, and that he did }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid not know
 how to account for it. " But what devotions }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid do you practise ?" asked the Abbot. The good Religious }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid replied that he did but little or nothing in this respect, }{except that he had ever taken great care t

 our farm-buildings where our corn and cattle were housed, did you not feel }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid some resentment in consequence ?" " No, my Father," }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid was his reply ; " but, on the contrary, I returned thanks }{\expnd1
\expndtw9\cgrid to God for it, as is my custom in similar cases, knowing }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid that God does, or permits, all for His own glory and for our greater good; and with this conviction, I am always }{content whatever may come to pass." Under
standing }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid all this, and seeing in that soul so great a conformity to }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid the Divine will, the Abbot was no longer surprised at }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid his performing such great miracles.

which I have found, and still do }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid find, all my peace." Such, in short, had this poor man }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid become through his union with the Divine will; and }{certainly he was, in all his poverty, more wealthy }{\expnd2
\expndtw10\cgrid than all the monarchs of the earth, and in his sufferings }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid more happy than all the men of the world in the midst }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of their earthly pleasures.

rs becomes continually more dark and }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid gloomy, till they know not where they go, and at length }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid walk over a precipice. " Not to advance," says }{\fs22\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid St. }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid Au
gustine, " is to go back." }{\fs22\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid St. }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid Gregory beautifully }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid explains this maxim of the spiritual life by comparing a }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid Christian who seeks to remain stationa
ry in the path of }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid virtue to a man who is in a boat on a rapid river, and }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid striving to keep the boat always in the same position. }{If the boat be not continually propelled against the }{\expnd1\expndtw9
\cgrid current, it }{\fs22\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid will }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid be carried away in an opposite direction, }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid and consequently, without continual exertion, its position }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid cannot be maintained. Si
nce the fall of Adam man is }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid naturally inclined to evil from his birth. }{\expnd4\expndtw23\i\cgrid For the }{\expnd3\expndtw15\i\cgrid imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid evil from his
 }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid youth\'97(Gen. viii. 21). If he do not push }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid forward, if he do not endeavour, by incessant efforts, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid to increase in sanctity, the very current of his passions }{\expnd3\expndtw17
\cgrid will carry him back. " Since you do not wish to pro\-}{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid ceed," says }{\fs22\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid St. }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid Bernard, addressing a tepid soul, " you }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid must recede." " By no means," 
she replied ; " I wish }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid to live, and to remain in my present state. I will not }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid consent to be worse ; and I do not wish to be better." }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid " Then," rejoins the Saint, " you wish to do
 the impos\-}{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid sible." Because, in the way of God, a Christian must }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid either go forward and advance in virtue, or go back\-}{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid ward into vice.

rnard says, " not to wish }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid to go forward, is certainly to fail." Hence St. John }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid Chrysostom exhorts us to think continually on the virtues }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid we do not possess, and never to reflect on
 the little good }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid we have done ; for the thought of our good works }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid " generates indolence and inspires arrogance," and }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid serves only to engender sloth in the way of the Lord, and to

. When God sends darkness }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid and desolations, it is then that He trys who are His }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid true friends. Palladius suffered great weariness in prayer; }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid and when he went to tell St. Macarius, t
he latter said }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid to him " When the thought suggests itself to leave }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid off prayer, let this be your reply : I am content, for the}{\expnd1\expndtw5\cgrid love of Jesus Christ, to remain here as guardian of the
 }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid walls of this cell." This, then, is your answer, whenever }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid you feel tempted to leave off prayer, because it appears }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid to you no better than a mere waste of time : " I am }{\expnd1
\expndtw7\cgrid here in order to give pleasure to God." St. Francis de }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid Sales used to say that if in time of prayer we did no }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid more than drive away distractions and temptations, our }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid 
prayer would, nevertheless, be well made. Nay, Tauler }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid says that on him who perseveres in prayer in a state }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of aridity, God will bestow greater graces than if he had prayed much with great sensible devotion
. F. Rodriguez }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid tells us of a certain person who said that during forty }{\expnd0\expndtw-3\cgrid years of prayer he had never experienced any consolation ; }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid but that on the days he prayed he found himself s
trong }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid in virtue ; whereas, on the contrary, whatever day he omitted prayer he experienced such a weakness as made }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid him unfit for anything good. It has been observed by }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid St. Bonaventu
re, and by Gerson, that many serve God better when deprived of that sensible devotion they long }{\expnd1\expndtw7\cgrid for, than when they possess it, because they thus live in a state of greater diligence and humility ; whereas }{\expnd1\expndtw6
\cgrid had they spiritual consolations they might perhaps be\-}{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid come proud and more tepid, thinking that they had }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid already gained the object of their desires. And what }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid is said with r
egard to aridity must also be said regarding }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid temptations. We should try to avoid temptations, but }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid if God wills or permits us to be tempted against the }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid Faith, against purity, or ag
ainst any other virtue, we }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid should not complain, but resign ourselves in this also }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid to the Divine will. To St. Paul who prayed to be }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid released from his temptation, the Lord made answ
er : }{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\i\cgrid My grace is suf}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\i\super\cgrid f}{\fs20\expnd1\expndtw8\i\cgrid icient for thee\'97(2 }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid Cor. xii. 9). And }{\expnd1\expndtw8\b\cgrid so, }{\fs14\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid if }{
\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid we see that God does not listen to us, and release }{\expnd1\expndtw6\cgrid us from some troublesome temptation, let us likewise }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid say : Lord, do and permit that which pleaseth Thee ; }{\expnd0\expndtw0
\cgrid Thy grace is sufficient for me ; only grant me Thy assist\-}{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid ance, that I may never lose it. It is not temptations, but the consenting to temptations, that causes us to }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid lose Divine grace. Temptations

\expndtw11\cgrid only of abjection, he delights in the humiliations which }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid are heaped upon him. Hence, as St. Bernard teaches, " he converts humiliation into humility "; so that all }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid the humiliations he re
ceives only serve to render him }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid more humble. St. Joseph Calasanctius used to say that }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid " he who loves God seeks not to be reputed a saint, but }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid to attain sanctity."

t he has no }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid claim to the virtues or to the good qualities ascribed to }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid him ; and he fears that by taking self-complacency in }{\expnd5\expndtw29\cgrid his good works he may lose whatever merit he }{

\expndtw0\cgrid St. Aloysius were greatly afflicted whenever they heard }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid themselves extolled. When you are praised or treated }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid with respect, humble your soul and tremble lest the}{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid ho

\expndtw11\cgrid And therefore He will have no rival in the affections of }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid our heart. Hence the spouse in the Canticles }{\expnd2\expndtw14\i\cgrid is }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid called }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid an enclosed garden. }

\expndtw13\cgrid learned by revelation that the monk did not turn away }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid instantly from the temptation, but used to stop to }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid look at it. The Father corrected him for this fault, }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid an
d the monk was not molested afterwards as much }{\expnd4\expndtw24\cgrid as before. " While the enemy is small," says St. Jerome, " kill him." A lion when small is easily }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid killed, but not when he has grown big. Unchaste }{\expnd2
\expndtw13\cgrid temptations must be instantly shaken off, as we shake }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid from the hand a spark that flies from the fire. The }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid best means of conquering them is, as I have said, to }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid t

of not }{\expnd4\expndtw23\cgrid falling into sin. St. Francis de Sales says : ' The }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid instant you feel any temptation, imitate children, who, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid when they see a wolf, run into the arms of their father }{
\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid or mother, or at least cry out to them for assistance. }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid Do you in like manner run with filial confidence to }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid Jesus and Mary."

 thou art }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid also offended by those who neglect to ask thy favours." For Mary's desire to enrich all with graces is, so to say, }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid a part of her nature, and she superabundantly enriches }{\expnd3\expndtw16
\cgrid her servants, as Blessed Raymond Jordan() affirms : }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid " Mary is God's treasurer, and the treasurer of His }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid graces, and she plentifully endows her servants with }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid choice gifts."

\expndtw19\cgrid Saint says, that " the prayers of this Mother have a }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid certain maternal authority with Jesus Christ ; so that }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid she obtains the grace of pardon even for those who have }{\expnd1\expndtw8

 say, that a soul out of prayer }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid is like a fish out of water ; the soul is, as it were, in a }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid violent state. Hence, after being a long time engaged }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid in business and distracting occ

f the Mother of }{\expnd4\expndtw20\cgrid God has the force of a command." Hence St. Peter }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Damien wrote that when Mary entreats Jesus Christ in }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid favour of one who is dearest to her, " she appears in a cer
tain sense to command as a mistress, not to ask }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid as a handmaid, for the Son honours her by denying her }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid nothing." For this reason St. Germanus says Mary can }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid obtain the pardon of t
