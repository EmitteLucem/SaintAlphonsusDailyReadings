e }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid which they had lost by their sin." Mary, then, was this }{great and valiant woman, who conquered the devil and crushed his head by bringing down his pride, as it was }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid foretold by God Himself : }{\expnd3

ugustine, and a great many others. However, be }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid it as it may, it is certain that either the Son by means }{of the Mother, or the Mother by means of the Son, has }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid overcome Lucifer ; so that, as St. Bernard r

\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid to obey the commands of this Queen. " Beaten down }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid and trampled under the feet of Mary, he endures a }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid wretched slavery." St. Bruno says " that Eve was the }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid 
cause of death," by allowing herself to be overcome by }{the serpent, " but that Mary," by conquering the devil, }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid " restored life to us." And she bound him in such al }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid way that this enemy cannot stir so as

 }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid is full of grace, not with the fulness of grace itself, for }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid she had not grace in the highest degree of excellence in which it can be had, nor had she it as to all its effects ; but she was said to be full
 of grace as to herself, because she had sufficient grace for that state to which she was chosen by God, that is, to be the Mother of His only-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid begotten Son." Hence Benedict Fernandez says that }{\expnd0\expndtw4\cgrid " the measur
e whereby we may know the greatness of }{\expnd0\expndtw-2\cgrid the grace communicated to Mary is her dignity of Mother }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid of God."

 grace for }{the benefit of all, so that all men might partake of it. }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid The Angelical Doctor adds that some Saints have so }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid much grace that it is not only sufficient for themselves, }{but also for the salvat
ion of many, though not for all }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid men ; only to Jesus Christ and to Mary was such a }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid grace given as sufficed to save all : " Should any one }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid have as much as would suffice for the sa
lvation of all, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid this would be the greatest : and this was in Christ and , }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid in the Blessed Virgin. So that what St. John (i. 16) }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid says of Jesus : }{\expnd2\expndtw10\i\cgrid And of
 his fulness we all have received, }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid the Saints say of Mary. St. Thomas of Villanova calls }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid her " full of grace, of whose plenitude all receive " ; so much so that St. Anselm says that " there is no one who
 }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid does not partake of the grace of Mary." And who is there in the world to whom Mary is not benign, and }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid does not dispense some mercy ? Who was ever found }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid to whom the Blessed Virg
in was not propitious ? Who }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid is there whom her mercy does not reach ?

receive a }{\expnd4\expndtw24\i0\cgrid second and a third, his strength will be so much }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid exhausted, that death will be the consequence. It is so }{\i0\cgrid with sin : after the first and second wound which it }{\expnd2
\expndtw13\i0\cgrid inflicts on the soul, she will still have some strength, }{\expnd2\expndtw11\i0\cgrid but only through the Divine grace. But, if she continue to indulge in vice, sin, becoming habitual, rushes upon }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i0\cgrid her like
 a giant and leaves her without any power to }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i0\cgrid resist it. St. Bernard compares the habitual sinner to a }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i0\cgrid person who has fallen under a large rock, which he is }{\i0\cgrid unable to remove. A person in
 such a case will rise }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i0\cgrid only with difficulty. " The man on whom the weight }{\expnd0\expndtw0\i0\cgrid of a bad habit presses, rises with difficulty."

 some\-}{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid times sin without pleasure, and sometimes even without }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid being in the occasion of sin. St. Bernardine compares }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid them to the wings of a wind-mill, which continue to }{turn the

\cgrid her death and returned to his abominations. In two }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid months after he was confined to bed by a slow fever. }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid He then sent for a confessor and made his Confession. }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid But after al
l this, on a certain day, he exclaimed : }{Alas ! how late have I known the rigour of Divine jus\-}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid tice ! And turning to his physician, he said : Do not }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid torment me any longer with your medicines, for my }
{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid disease is incurable. I know for certain that it will }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid bring me to the grave. And to his friends, who stood }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid around, he said : As for the life of this body of mine }{\expnd1

is I see in the hardness of my }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid heart. Friends and Religious came to encourage him to }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid hope in the mercy of God ; but his answer to all their }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid exhortations was : God has abandoned m
e. The writer}{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid who relates this fact says that, being alone with the }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid young man, he said to him : Have courage ; unite your\-}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid self to God and receive the Viaticum. Friend, replied }
{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid the young man, speak to a stone ! The Confession I }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid have made has been null for want of sorrow. I do not }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid wish for a confessor, nor for the Sacraments. Do not }{bring me the Viatic
um; for, should you bring it, I will }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid do that which must excite your horror. The friend then }{went away quite disconsolate ; and returning next day }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid to see the young man he learned from his relatives that
 he expired during the night without the aid of a priest, }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid and that near his room frightful howlings were heard. }{Behold the end of habitual sinners ! If you have had }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid the misfortune to contract a habit of

St. Paul when he wrote to his disciples : }{\expnd2\expndtw12\i\cgrid For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God\'97(2 }{\expnd3\expndtw16\cgrid Cor. v. 20). Commenting upon this passage St. John }{\expnd3\expndtw19\cgrid Chrysostom makes a beautifu

rine }{\expnd5\expndtw25\cgrid may be inferred from the following passages of }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid Scripture : }{\expnd2\expndtw13\i\cgrid We ought always to }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid pray\'97(Luke xviii. 1). }{\expnd3\expndtw16\i\cgrid Ask, and }{

\expnd3\expndtw17\i\cgrid we ought, }{\i\cgrid ask, }{pray, according to St. Thomas, and the generality }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid of Theologians, imply a precept which obliges, under }{\expnd3\expndtw15\cgrid grievous sin, particularly in three cases : (1
) When a }{man is in the state of sin ; (2) When he is in danger of }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid falling into sin; and (3) When he is in danger of death. }{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid Theologians teach, that he who, at other times neglects }{\expnd3\expndtw18
\cgrid prayer for a month, or at most for two months, can\-}{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid not be excused from mortal sin ; because without }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid prayer we cannot procure the helps necessary for the }{\expnd3\expndtw17\cgrid observance of th

ulfil all the commandments, still he }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid can, by prayer, obtain the additional helps necessary}{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid for their observance. " God does not command impos\-}{sibilities ; but, by His precepts, He admonishes you to }{
\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid do what you can, and to ask what you cannot do ; and }{\expnd4\expndtw22\cgrid He assists you that you may be able to do it." To }{\expnd4\expndtw24\cgrid this may be added another celebrated passage of }{St. Augustine : " By our f
aith, which teaches that God does not command impossibilities, we are admonished }{\expnd2\expndtw14\cgrid what to do in things that are easy, and what to ask in }{\expnd0\expndtw0\cgrid things that are difficult."

 }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid Hence they who are conquered cannot excuse them\-}{\expnd2\expndtw10\cgrid selves by saying that they had not strength to resist the }{assault of the enemy; for had they asked aid from God, }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid He would hav

\cgrid ask\'97(James iv. 2). }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid St. John Chrysostom says that prayer is a powerful }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid weapon of defence against all enemies. " Truly prayer }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid is a strong armour." St. Ephrem writes that

 if He does not give us the grace we ask, will grant a more useful gift. " He will give either what }{\expnd2\expndtw11\cgrid we ask, or what He knows to be more profitable to }{\expnd0\expndtw3\cgrid us." And whom has God ever despised by not listening }

e ; meaning that he who loves }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid God desires nothing but to love Him, and banishes from }{\expnd3\expndtw18\cgrid his heart everything that is not God. And thus it is }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid that, from being empty the heart becomes
 full, that is, }{\expnd1\expndtw8\cgrid full of God, Who with Himself brings every good thing ; }{\expnd2\expndtw13\cgrid and then earthly pleasures, finding no place in such a heart, have no power over it. What power can earthly }{\expnd1\expndtw7

n to possess a share in the riches of Paradise ? To measure, therefore, the advance }{\expnd2\expndtw12\cgrid we have made in the ways of God, let us observe what }{\expnd1\expndtw9\cgrid advance we have made in loving Him; whether }{\expnd1\expndtw9\i
