<p>CHARITY TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOUR.</p>

<p>An act of Charity performed towards a neighbour will be accepted by Jesus Christ as done to Himself.  <i>I say to you,</i> says the Redeemer, <i>as long as you did it to one of these, my least brethren, you did it to me&mdash;</i>(Matt. xxv. 40).  St. Catharine of Genoa used to say our love of God is to be measured by our love for our neighbour.</p>

<p>To love God without at the same time loving our neighbour is impossible.  The same precept that prescribes love towards God imposes a strict obligation of brotherly Charity.  <i>And this commandment we have from God that he who loveth God love also his brother&mdash;</i>(1 John iv. 21).  Hence St. Thomas teaches that the love of God and the love of our neighbour proceed alike from Charity.  For Charity makes us love God and our neighbour, because such is the will of God.  Such, too, was the doctrine of St. John the Evangelist.  St. Jerome relates that being asked by his disciples why he frequently recommended fraternal love, that holy Apostle replied:  "Because it is the precept of the Lord, and the fulfilment of it alone is sufficient."</p>
